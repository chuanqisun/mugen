# What

- An integrated generative environment (IGE)

## Key features

- **Everything is scriptable**: Message, Tool, Agent, Artifacts, Environment have APIs exposed to both human and agents.
- **Concurrent**: Parallel dispatch of actions, powered by Elm architecture.
- **Grain of the web**: HTML and URL as first class citizen. Easy to parser. Easy to traverse.

## Metaphors

- Shell: task and flow control for a kernel, with scripting
- Notebook: sequential cells of computation
- Browser: hypermedia and navigation

## Design paradigms

- Content generation: from nothing to a draft
- Global editing: globally change the content, find and replace on steroids
- Local editing: surgical retouch
- Transfer: change one thing while using another as reference
